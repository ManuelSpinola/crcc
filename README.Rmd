The goal of crcc is to provides geospatial data of Costa Rica to do climate change analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version of crcc from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ManuelSpinola/crcc")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(crcc)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
